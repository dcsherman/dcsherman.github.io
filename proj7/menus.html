				<h1>A Website To Go With Your YouTube Channel</h1>
				<p>We should consider the creation of a holistic task flow diagram or site map of the product, one of our first primary concerns. If need be, we can shut our office door and produce this map alone based on research we have completed to date. There are situations wherein it is better to shut out the noise of opinion so that we can process everything to come up with a recommended solution. However, I would recommend calling the stakeholders and important team members in for a brainstorming session. I have found it expedites the mapping process immensely when we have everyone in the same room talking over possible solutions.</p>
				<p>If we were to search the Internet for the meaning of flowchart shapes, we would find <a href="#">thousands of examples</a> and possibly a few different interpretations for what each shape and line quality mean. Adopting and applying a deeper visual vernacular can greatly expand the amount of information we can pack into our interaction maps. That being said, we shouldn't consider it a requirement to adopt these charting languages in their entirety. It is good to be familiar with the industry standards for creating flowcharts, and whether we adopt or modify is perfectly acceptable, as long as the flow of information is clearly mapped out and easy to comprehend at a glance. Understanding the basic principles of task flow creation should be enough to get us started.</p>

				<h3>Hamm- Wireframing Essentials (2014)</h3>
				<p>User Experience (UX) design is the act and art of crafting the interface and interactions for a website or application. It is a multidisciplinary career path that requires one to be part visual designer, part social psychologist, a little bit of a developer, and a hint of a project manager, as well as possess a great deal of empathy for those whom you are designing for.</p>
